    -- With monoidal-containers-0.6.0.1, there is an issue deriving Eq1:
    --   - src/Data/HashMap/Monoidal.hs:74:16: error:
    --       â€¢ Could not deduce (Data.Functor.Classes.Eq1 (MonoidalHashMap k)) ...
    --
    -- This is fixed in monoidal-containers-0.6.2.0.
    --
    -- We can't use monoidal-containers-0.6.2.0 however because it requires:
    --   - witherable >=0.4 && <0.5
    -- and reflex-0.8.2.0 requires:
    --   - witherable >=0.3 && <0.4
    --
    -- However, we can allow reflex to use a newer version of witherable to work
    -- around this problem. It appears the upper bound on witherable in reflex
    -- is overzealous anyway.
